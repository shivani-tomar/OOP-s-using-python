# Abstraction :- 

Abstraction is a concept in which we provide the user only useful information which he/she want. Unnecessary information are hidden and not provided to the user level. 
Lets understand it with an example. When we go to the bank to deposit some amount or take a loan then we are provided the information by the bank employees which we required. Unnecessary information or internal working or internal process information is not given to us.

Like , I am going to bank to deposit some amount then I will be asked to fill form and get token and when my chance come then they will take my amount and deposit it in my account. They don't tell us what calculation they will going to do to deposit amount in my account neither they going to tell me that they require addition mathematical operator. Because , its unnecesary information for me . My only purpose to deposit amount not to check what calculation they are doing. This is called abstraction.

Same thing applies in while we deposit loan, bank employee tell us monthly amount which we pay. All the calculation is done by the bank not by us. Because all these information like interest , credentials , rate of interest is not useful information for us . Yeah ... no doubt, these information is important for bank employees.
