# Intro to OOP's :-

The whole world comprises of objects whether its table, chair, water-bottles , lappy, pen, pencil or anything. That's why we use object oriented programming in computational world. object oriented paradigm consist of two basic pillars which are given below : -

1) class
2) objects

## Class :-

A class may be defined as the blue print of the object which have no space in memory. It is like as the declaration of variable in procedure oriented programming which was not allocated any memory. As blue print is the lay out of the strucutres and actions . Same thing as class does. A class consist of data variables and methods which represent attributes of any object and  actions of the objects. It is the class which going to tell what will happen when you create the object of class.

## Objects : - 

AN Object may be defined as the instance of the class having all data members and methods of class with required memory allocation i.e. an object has space in memory.
