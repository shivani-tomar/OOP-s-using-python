# Why do we need oops ?

The very first question arises why do we need to learn oops concept or object oriented programming even we can do functional programming or procedural programming. So, let me tell you guys , there are some disadvantages of functional programming or procedural programming due to which object oriented programming starts which are given below : -

## Disadvantages of procedural programming or functional programming :-

1) Procedural programming is easy to write but difficult to debug . 

2) Sometimes it is difficult to update the code as it can affect other modules also.

3) There is code repeatition which is results in waste of memory, time , hard work of developer and many more.

4) There may be code collision i.e. same name of variable , methods etc within a team.

5) Unneccesary information is provided to all which may not useful to that particular person.

6) There could not be module testing or component testing in procedural programming .

7) The code is in scattered form . It will not be bundled easily.

8) The code structure is clumsy and ambigious.

Due to these disadvantages oop's came into existance. There could be many more which I have not listed.

## Advantages of oop's : -

In this world, everything is in form of object same as in computer . In computer, we try to map real world entity to computing world. This is the place where object oriented paradigm came into place. While solving problem in a computer, main problem arises when we try to map real world things by procedural progamming which become very hard to do it. OOP's have another advantages also which are given below :

1) It provides developer the code reusability benefits by using inheritance concept.

2) The whole project can be divided into small components on the basis of classes so its easy to debug a code in OOP's and testing is       also comparatively easy .

3) Due to better naming conventions there is no ambiguity in the code on the basis of names of methods and variables.

4) It don't provide internal process information and only provide useful information working on abstraction level.

5) In OOP's its easy to bind up the whole data within a single class.

6) Its easy to add new methods and functionality in project even after release without affecting the previous version using inheritance.

7) Its easy to do updation in the object oriented function.

8) The code is very clean and well structured in OOP's paradigm.

9) OOP's provide security to data by using access modifier.

That's why we need to understand oop's concept. In the following chapters , I'm going to describe oop's concept using python with examples and implementation. I hope you will like it.
