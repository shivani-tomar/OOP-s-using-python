# Why do we need oops ?

The very first question arises why do we need to learn oops concept or object oriented programming even we can do functional programming or procedural programming. So, let me tell you guys , there are some disadvantages of functional programming or procedural programming due to which object oriented programming starts which are given below : -

## Disadvantages of procedural programming or functional programming :-

1) Procedural programming is easy to write but difficult to debug . 

2) Sometimes it is difficult to update the code as it can affect other modules also.

3) There is code repeatition which is results in waste of memory, time , hard work of developer and many more.

4) There may be code collision i.e. same name of variable , methods etc within a team.

5) Unneccesary information is provided to all which may not useful to that particular person.

6) There could not be module testing or component testing in procedural programming .

7) The code is in scattered form . It will not be bundled easily.

Due to these disadvantages oop's came into existance. There could be many more which I have not listed.
