# Polymorphism :- 
 
Polymorphism is made up of two words - Poly + Morphism where poly means many morphism means identity. Or you can say in simple words same name but different work.

In this concept, a class can have methods with same name but different in work. Now, the problem is when a class having two functions with same name then how it will identify which function to implement when we call it. 

There are two methods by which compiler or interpreter cames to know which function is getting calls.
1) Number of arguements
2) Datatypes of arguments

First , compiler or interpreter match the number of passed parameters to the number of arguements. If both are same then it will call the function and if it don't find any match they started comparing the datatypes of passed parameters to the datatype of arguement of the function/method and mostly matched function/method gets executed.
